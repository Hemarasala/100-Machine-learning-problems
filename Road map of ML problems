#Roadmap of Machine Learning Problems
Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and a superset of Deep Learning.
Mechanism of ML follows:
1.Learn the data, identify the hidden patterns, and improve the performance.
2.ML analyzes large datasets.
3.ML makes decisions, predictions, and recommendations
