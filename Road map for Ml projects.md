#Roadmap of Machine Learning Problems

Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and a superset of Deep Learning.
Mechanism of ML follows:
1.Learn the data, identify the hidden patterns, and improve the performance.
2.ML analyzes large datasets.
3.ML makes decisions, predictions, and recommendations

Mechanism of ML:
1.Input
2.Feature Extraction
3.Classification

Types of Ml:
1.Supervised-Uses labeled data (input + correct output)
ex:Classification, Regression
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Decision Tree




2.Unsupervised- Uses unlabeled data
Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA



3. Semi-Supervised Learning-Uses small labeled data + large unlabeled data
Applications: Medical imaging, speech recognition



4.Reinforcement-Learns by trial and error through rewards and penalties
Applications: Robotics, gaming, self-driving cars
Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN)
